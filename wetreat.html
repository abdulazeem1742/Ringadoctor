                            <p class="t_para">Cold and Flu both are caused by viruses. A cold is a milder respiratory illness and can make you feel bad for a few days. Common symptoms are runny nose - beginning with clear mucus that develops into thicker, green mucus as the cold progresses - blocked nose, sore throat, sneezing and cough. Cold is most contagious during the early stages, when the person has a runny nose and sore throat.</p>
                            <p class="t_para">Whereas the flu can make you feel quite ill for a few days to weeks. Common symptoms are sudden fever of 38 - 40C (100 - 104F), muscle aches and pains, sweating, exhaustion and cough. Flu can also result in serious health problems such as pneumonia and hospitalizations.
                                Whether a Cold or Flu, get medical help immediately and Ring a Doctor.</p>

                            <p class="t_para">When you have allergies and you come into contact with the allergen, your immune system's reaction can inflame your skin, sinuses, airways or digestive system.</p>

                                Allergies are serious. Ring a Doctor to relieve your allergy symptoms.</p>

                                Conditions that irritate, clog, or inflame your skin can cause symptoms such as redness, swelling, burning, and itching. Allergies, irritants, your genetic makeup, and certain diseases and immune system problems can cause dermatitis, hives, and other skin conditions. Skin can also develop several kinds of cancers.

Depression is more than just a low mood. It's a serious condition that affects your physical and mental health.</p>
                            <p class="t_para">nxiety is more than just feeling stressed or worried. While stress and anxious feelings are a common response to a situation where we feel under pressure, they usually pass once the stressful situation has passed, or stressor is removed.

                                Anxiety is when these anxious feelings don't subside, when they're ongoing and exist without any particular reason or cause. It is a serious condition that makes it hard to cope with daily life.

                            <p class="t_para">Most people suffer from gastrointestinal problems but they don't like to talk about it. There is no need to suffer in silence. Some of the most common digestive conditions and their symptoms are mentioned here, if you suspect you have any of these issues than don't delay in calling your doctor.</p>
                            <p class="t_para_blue">Chest Pain or Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)</p>
                            <p class="t_para">When stomach acid backs up into your esophagus - a condition called acid reflux - you may feel a burning pain in the middle of your chest. It often occurs after meals or at night.

                                If you experience persistent heartburn, bad breath, tooth erosion, nausea, pain in your chest or upper part of your abdomen, or have trouble swallowing or breathing, call your doctor.</p>

                                <p class="t_para">These are hard deposits that form in a small pear shaped sack that stores and secretes bile for digestion - gall bladder. Gallstones are formed due to high cholesterol or waste in bile or if gallbladder does not empty properly.

                                    When gallstones block the ducts leading from gallbladder to intestine can cause sharp pain in upper right abdomen. Four Fs of gallbladder disease, listed as follows, help you know if you are at risk:</p>   
                                    <p class="t_para_blue">Celiac Disease</p>
                                    <p class="t_para">Celiac disease is a serious sensitivity to gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. It damages your villi, the finger-like protrusions in small intestines that help to absorb nutrients from the foods we eat. Symptoms of celiac disease in kids include abdominal pain and bloating, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, and weight loss. Symptoms in adults also can include anemia, fatigue, bone loss, depression, and seizures.</p>
